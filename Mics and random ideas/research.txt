the pain sensitivity is different, 
the response to the anesthesia is also different 

quantification of anesthesia using real time brain wave 

Topic : 'brain wave analysis for medical treatment' 

Treatments are being done according to the feedback of patients in critical condition which is not scientific.But we want to measure the migrain/pain/ using brain wave

/post-surgery

Scope of treatment are diversified if we know the pain tolerance of patient beforehand. 

state of mental health 

diagnosis of mental disease
stress calculation 

understanding how the brain functions
relation between brain wave and medical treatment method
relation between brain wave and medical condtition.
precise treatment 

((recurring pattern in the collected data) diagnosis is easier.)
what can we solve if we have brain wave data? 
- inaccurate dosage of medications
- diagnosis is easier.
